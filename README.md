# Summary

The LuxBank corpus currently consists of the translated Cairo Cicling examples, and will be extended to include examples from a national dataset. It is the first comprehensive tree bank dataset for Luxembourgish.

# Introduction

The LuxBank corpus is the first treebank corpus of Luxembourgish. While the initial test set consists of the translated Cairo Cicling examples, the corpus will be expanded to include texts from various domains, including but not limited to news articles, encyclopaedic articles and literary examples.

# Acknowledgements

The translation of the initial Cairo Cicling examples to Luxembourgish was carried out by Christoph Purschke and Caroline Döhmer. The annotation of the initial set was carried out by Anne-Marie Lutgen, Emilia Milano and Caroline Döhmer, who also created the first set of guidelines for annotating Luxembourgish.
